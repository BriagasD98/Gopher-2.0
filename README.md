# Gopher-2.0

**Gopher 2.0** is an updated version of the **Gopher 1.0** project which was collaboratively created in June 2021.
**Gopher 1.0** was a static webpage which was meant to be an event finder to help users find events in their area that they may be
interested in. **Gopher 2.0** is a social media site used to create and share events made by users nationwide. There is a
**Dashboard that showcases featured events created by users** and a navigation bar that leads to other pages whithin the site.
Users will be able to **sign in and sign up for Gopher in a dedicated login page**. Users will be able to **post, edit and delete original
events from a dashboard page** once they've logged into their account. Users will also be able to **search for events by category**. On every
event post, users will be able to **post Comments and Like/mark as "Going" to events**. There will also be an integrated **google maps** in the
website which users can utilize to get directions to posted events. User credentials will be encrypted using **bcrypt** which "hashes" user
information so their personal information is safe & won't be compromised. The new goal for **Gopher** developers is to make it
safer and easier for event-seekers to **Gopher it.**
